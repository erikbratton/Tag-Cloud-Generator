# Tag-Cloud-Generator

This project involves creating a tag cloud generator using standard Java libraries. The goal is to design and implement a component-based application that leverages Java Collections Framework (e.g., Map, List) and file I/O components (FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter). The program should handle IOExceptions with appropriate error messages and meet functional requirements similar to a previous project. The project was set up in Eclipse, shared using Subversion.
